Starting from a class called Vehicle with attributes nr_wheels, color, top_speed and method start_engine which
returns the speed range, create two sub classes Motorbike and Truck.

1. Create 2 motorbikes and 2 trucks with different arguments.

2. Add a method, get_real_max_speed which returns the max_speed substracting the air resistance
15 km/h air resistance is available for all motorbikes, 50 km/h for all trucks.

max_speed() -> int

3. Add a method to the parent class convert_to_mph, where the speed is converted into miles/h (1 mile = 1.6 km)

convert_to_mph() -> float (1 decimal digits)

4. Count how many vehicles are currently instantiated using the Parent class.
e.g. Vehicle.total_number = 4

But if we delete one object, that parameter should reflect that.

e.x.
if initial we had 4 objects
Vehicle.total_number = 4

del instance/object

Vehicle.total_number = 3

5. Add a verification method to parent class, that the top speed cannot be modified if the new speed under 50 km/h.
Note: do not use if logical inside init.

e.x.
print(m1.speed)	Output:	190
m1.speed = 21	Output: Speed has to be over 50 km/h.
print(m1.speed)	Output: 190

print(m1.speed)	Output:	190
m1.speed = 51	Output:
print(m1.speed)	Output: 51
